HowTo install RSAP
==================

The easiest way to install RSAP is to clone the repository and use
R CMD INSTALL

You must ensure that you have the nwrfcsdk installed which is 
available through downloads on the SAP Service Market Place

Set the environment variables that locate the INCLUDE and LIB
directories:

export NWRFCSDK_INCLUDE=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/include
export NWRFCSDK_LIBS=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib

Then run the build and install command from the package root 
directory:

R CMD INSTALL --build --preclean --clean .

This has been tested under Ubuntu 12.04 - how it builds on
other platforms is unknown.
