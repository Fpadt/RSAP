HowTo install RSAP
==================

The easiest way to install RSAP is to clone the repository and use
R CMD INSTALL

You must ensure that you have the nwrfcsdk installed which is 
available through downloads on the SAP Service Market Place

Set the environment variables that locate the INCLUDE and LIB
directories:

export NWRFCSDK_INCLUDE=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/include
export NWRFCSDK_LIBS=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib

Then run the build and install command from the package root 
directory:

R CMD INSTALL --build --preclean --clean .

This has been tested under Ubuntu 12.04 - how it builds on
other platforms is unknown.


Windows build instructions
============================

Thanks to Alvaro for making this work.  This was last used for R-2.15.0 under 64bit architecture.

Download RTools (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) for your R installation version
Inside the /src folder copy all the content from the following folders:
   /include from your R installation
   /include from your nwrfcsdk folder
   /lib from your nwrfcsdk folder
Make sure that you're using the right R for the NWRFCSDK folder...R 64bit for NWRFCSDK 64bits.
 You can check this is you go to Environment Variables --> Path and look for something like this C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.0\bin\x64 (x32 or x64)

C:\> R CMD INSTALL --build --preclean --clean --no-multiarch -l C:/RSAP RSAP
